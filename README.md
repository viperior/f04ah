# Fallout 4 AutoHacker

This program is designed to automatically solve hacking terminals in the Fallout 4 video game.

To make this I *literally* had to level up my IRL Hacking skill.

Now with improved logic!

Disclaimer:
In case you have no idea what Fallout is and think you've stumbled into the deep web, you have not. Fallout is a role-playing video game series by Bethesda Studios. In the Fallout games, there are mini-games which the player must win to unlock loot or mission objectives. One of these mini-games is called Hacking. Hacking is performed by interacting with a Terminal, which is a logical puzzle where the player must guess the correct, fictional password in a limited number of tries to unlock the terminal.
