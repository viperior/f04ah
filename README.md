# Fallout 4 AutoHacker

This program is designed to automatically solve hacking terminals in the Fallout 4 video game.

To make this I *literally* had to level up my IRL Hacking skill.

This initial version is a very basic and dumb prototype. It works, but lacks sophisticated logic to make it faster.

To improve this, I will need to add code so after the first password candidate is attempted, it can start to deduce which letters can go in which slots by a process of elimination. It could also suggest which candidate to try next, based on the probability that said candidate will eliminate the most candidates, thus solving the problem in less steps.
