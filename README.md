# Fallout 4 AutoHacker

This program is designed to automatically solve hacking terminals in the Fallout 4 video game.

To make this I *literally* had to level up my IRL Hacking skill.

This initial version is a very basic and dumb prototype. It works, but lacks sophisticated logic to make it faster.

To improve this, I will need to add code so after the first password candidate is attempted, it can start to deduce which letters can go in which slots by a process of elimination. It could also suggest which candidate to try next, based on the probability that said candidate will eliminate the most candidates, thus solving the problem in fewer steps.

Disclaimer:
In case you have no idea what Fallout is and think you've stumbled into the deep web, you have not. Fallout is a role-playing video game series by Bethesda Studios. In the Fallout games, there are mini-games which the player must win to unlock loot or mission objectives. One of these mini-games is called Hacking. Hacking is performed by interacting with a Terminal, which is a logical puzzle where the player must guess the correct, fictional password in a limited number of tries to unlock the terminal.
